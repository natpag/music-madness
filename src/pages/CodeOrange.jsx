       Underneath is the record Code Orange have been threatening to deliver since 
       they had the word “Kids” in their name. It foregrounds glitchy industrial touches 
       and synthesizes them with a chaotic, mathematical approach without sacrificing the 
       melodic ground that the band gained on Forever. If anything, these songs are more 
       memorable and cohesive than those on its predecessor. Drummer-vocalist Jami Morgan 
       and guitarist-vocalist Reba Meyers have perfected their twin-throated approach, and 
       also sharpened their hooks to a practically atom-thick point."
